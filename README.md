# dotfiles
...Ansible style.

After noticing that (1) my dotfiles are chock full of sh*t I don't use, and (2) don't translate well to the many wonderful flavors of Linux, I decided to re-do the whole mess with Ansible.

Work in progress, for now.

Need to figure out if I still want to use ZSH.  Can't find a reason why I _should_.
